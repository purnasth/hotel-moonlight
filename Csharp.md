## Model Binding in ASP.NET Core

Model binding is the process of mapping data from an HTTP request to action method parameters. In ASP.NET Core, model binding is done by the model binding system. The model binding system is responsible for mapping data from an HTTP request to action method parameters. The model binding system can bind data from various sources such as query string, form data, route data, and request body.

### Model Binding Sources

The model binding system can bind data from various sources such as query string, form data, route data, and request body. The model binding system uses the following sources to bind data to action method parameters:

- Query String: The query string is used to pass data to the server as key-value pairs. The query string is appended to the URL after the question mark (?). For example, `https://example.com?name=John&age=30`.

- Form Data: Form data is used to pass data to the server using HTML forms. Form data is sent to the server as key-value pairs. Form data can be sent using the `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` or `multipart/form-data` content types.

- Route Data: Route data is used to pass data to the server as part of the URL path. Route data is extracted from the URL path using route templates.

- Request Body: The request body is used to pass data to the server in the body of an HTTP request. The request body can contain data in various formats such as JSON, XML, or form data.

### Model Binding Process

The model binding system uses the following process to bind data to action method parameters:



NOTE: @ is a razor syntax used in .cshtml files to access the model properties. It is not a part of the C# language. It is a template engine used in ASP.NET Core to render HTML content.

## Data Annotations

Data annotations are attributes that can be applied to model properties to specify validation rules, display formatting, and other metadata. Data annotations are used to provide additional information about model properties to the model binding system and other components of the ASP.NET Core framework.
